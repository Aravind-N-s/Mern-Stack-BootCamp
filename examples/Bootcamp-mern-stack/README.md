>A stack is the combination of technologies used to create a web application. Any web application will be made using multiple technologies (frameworks, libraries, databases etc).
The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack thatâ€™s designed to make the development process smoother. MERN includes four open-source components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These components provide an end-to-end framework for developers to work in. 



## Technologies
 - **MongoDB** is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.It uses JSON-like documents with schema. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). 
 - **Express Js** is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
 - **React Js** (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. 
 - **Node Js** is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
